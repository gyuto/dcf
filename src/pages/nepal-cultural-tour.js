        Join us on a special tour to explore Nepal with Ven Donyo. Nepal is an
        excellent country for a cultural sightseeing tour, with its long
        history, fascinating art, and unique and varied architecture. We have
        prepared this special itinerary to showcase the vast diversity of
        people, their culture, language, and traditions. During this tour, we
        will experience the natural beauty of Pokhara, the wildlife of Chitwan,
        and the Buddhist pilgrimage sites in and around Kathmandu. Nepal’s two
        predominant religions, Hinduism and Buddhism, are ever present, with a
        variety of gods and goddesses, temples, stupas, and monasteries that
        depict the deep faith of the people.

        In the morning, we will visit Swayambhunath stupa. According to legend,
        the Kathmandu Valley was filled with a great lake, at the center of
        which a lotus flower grew. With the slash of the sword of Manjushri, the
        Buddha of Wisdom, the lake was drained, and the lotus settled on top of
        the hill and transformed into the stupa. Following the trip to the
        stupa, we will visit one of the monasteries near Swayambhu. Then we will
