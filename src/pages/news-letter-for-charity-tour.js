      <p>Dear Friends,</p>
      <p>Warm Greetings to you!</p>

      <p>
        Today I am writing this email as the Director of Delek Children's
        Foundation. Past few months, I have been working remotely on this
        project after my retirement from Gyuto Foundation. The transfer of the
        Gyuto Foundation to the main monastery went smoothly and was very
        successful. The monastery has requested me to sit in the board of Gyuto
        Foundation as an advisor and I agreed to continue to assist the center
        whenever needed.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am now happy to dedicate my remaining years to Delek Children's
        Foundation by providing children in need with an education and
        healthcare throughout the Himalayan region of India, Nepal, Bhutan and
        Tibet, irrespective of their ethnicity and national boundaries. This
        foundation is a charitable 501 (c)(3) non-profit organization and we
        hope to enrich the lives of underprivileged children with better future.
        Since 2010, I have been providing financial support to these children
        with help of some generous Gyuto members. After I handed over the center
        to the main monastery, I started Delek Children's Foundation so that I
        can focus more on the children's education.

        Last year in November, I led a charity tour with some of the Gyuto
        members to India. Once the tour ended, I stayed back and visited remote
        areas of North East India to get an update on families to whom I have
        supported till now. I realized that there is still much more to be done.
        To raise funds for the Children's Foundation, I will be organizing more
        Charity Tours at least once a year. This year, I will be leading a
        Charity Tour from Ladakh to Dharamsala from Aug 17th to September 3rd
        2017 which will also include His Holiness The Dalai Lama's four days
        teachings in Dharamsala,India. I will send more details through a
        separate email and will also post the information on our website .

        As I embark on my new journey, I once again request for your support and
        your help to spread the word out. I am very thankful to you for your
        past support and donations till now to every projects I have undertaken,
        be it the center or the children's education.
