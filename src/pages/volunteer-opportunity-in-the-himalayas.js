        We are pleased to announce that we have expanded the scope of the
        volunteer trip to the schools in Solukhumbu. Thanks to your generous
        support, we have found an English teacher for Shree Dorpu School. The
        staff and students are anticipating his arrival in April, 2019. When
        Ven. Donyo asked how else the Delek Children’s Foundation could help,
        the Headmistress requested our assistance with urgent needs for the
        school. In addition to bringing educational toys for the students, we
        decided to host a group of volunteers who could work with a local team
        to build a water tank, library and a playground next to the main
        building.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before the main cultural tour starts, Ven. Donyo will visit his village
        in Solukhumbu, Nepal and visit the schools where we provide sponsorship
        for some children. He will spent most of his time at Shree Dorpu Primary
        School where we are planning to undertake some projects to improve the
        facilities in the school. Currently, the school does not have proper
        sanitation and water system. They also lack proper furniture in the
        classroom and does not have a playground. With sufficient funds and
        donations, we hope to provide the following facilities to the school.
      </p>
      <p>
        <li>4 new toilets for the students and the staff: $2000</li>
        <li>
          New water tank $500 Metal cabinets and wooden book shelves: $400
        </li>
        <li>Some office chairs, tables and benches: $350</li>
        <li>Students uniforms: $600</li>
        <li>Set of computer with printer with supplies: $1,500</li>
        <li>Small playground with swings and sliding: $1,000</li>

        <li>Sport supplies: $300</li>
