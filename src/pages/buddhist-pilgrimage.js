        <p>
          Thank you for your interest to join our Charity Tour to Buddhist
          Pilgrimage sites. This is one of our popular trips and we hope to run
          this tour as often as possible.

          <b>Please note</b>: during the tour we will be staying in 2 to 4 star
          hotels that are often fully booked during pilgrimage season between
          November - February. Our hotel names are listed in the itinerary
          below. While in Nepal, we will NOT be visiting Kathmandu, the capital
          of Nepal, but will visit Lumbini, the birthplace of Buddha which is
          located just near the border area inside Nepal. We will be flying two
          times, at the beginning and end of the tour, and traveling by charter
          bus the rest of the tour. Joining the pilgrimage will not only benefit
          to develop your spiritual path, but also help in raising some funds
          for Delek Children's Education. A pilgrimage is a journey to a sacred
          place as an act of devotion and faith. Many enlightened beings have
          advised to visit the place where the Buddha was born, the place where
          the Buddha attained Enlightenment, the place where he preached the
          first teaching, and where he passed away into Mahaparinirvana. During
          the pilgrimage, we will visit the major holy sites of Buddha such as:
          Lumbini - birthplace of Buddha, Kushinagar - where Buddha passed into
          Mahaparinirvana, Rajgir - where Buddha gave teachings on the Heart
          Sutra, Nalanda - Ruins of the Ancient Buddhist University, Varanasi -
          where Buddha preached his first discourse, and finally Bodh Gaya -
          where Buddha attained enlightenment.  Please see below for the
          complete list of sites and the corresponding itinerary.
          <br />
