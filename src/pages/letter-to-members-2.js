      <p>Dear Friends,</p>
      <p>
        Tashi Delek! Our Director, Ven. Donyo, is back from his trips. This
        year, he led three different groups to Nepal and India and had a
        fulfilling experience helping many schools and families. He also led a
        group of 30 members to Dharamsala to celebrate the 600th anniversary of
        Gyuto Monastery.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Foundation has been able to reach our targeted projections for this
        year due to your generous year round support and donations from the
        fundraising dinner in September.
      </p>

      <h4>Visit to Solukhumbu</h4>

      <p>
        Before the Charity tour started, the group visited Kopan Monastery in
        Kathmandu. After a 12 hour jeep ride, Ven Donyo visited the Solukhumbu
        with three volunteers from US, four family members, a fellow monk, a
        videographer, and a cinematographer. He met with the 22 students whose
        school fees are provided by Delek Children’s Foundation. The group also
        visited four schools in the area and provided jackets, school bags, and
        shoes to 330 students. In addition, Ven. Donyo provided funds to
        purchase a solar water heater for the local monastery, which was damaged
        by the earthquake. There are only 12 monks there, supported by the
        Sherpa community. This part of the trip was rugged, more like a trek
        than a tourist jaunt. The group stayed in a small mountain hotel in
        Salleri, the Hill View. From the roof top, we could see Nom Bru, a
        nearby Himalayan peak. One morning, the group got up early and took a
        jeep ride to view Mt. Everest at dawn. That evening, they sat down to a
        meal of black millet, a staple food of the Sherpas who live in Nepal.
      </p>

      <h4>New Toilets for Shree Dorpu School</h4>

      <p>
        The next school to visit was Shree Dorpu, where we have been sponsoring
        an English teacher since April of this year. The toilet project was
        nearing completion when Ven Donyo visited. The foundation also provided
        books, toys, school supplies, and funds to renovate the furniture and
        the playground. The children and staff greeted the visitors with katas
        and marigold wreaths. The children sang, gave speeches, and a welcome
        dance. The principal was especially delighted by the books. Because of
        our generous supporters, we are grateful that we have been able to
        fulfill the school’s needs.
      </p>
      <h4>Visit to Ropang School, Dhading</h4>
      <p>
        After returning to Kathmandu, the volunteers visited a primary school on
        a cliff in a remote village in Dhading. The students studying here walk
        for hours to reach the school and barely have proper clothes or shoes to
        wear, yet their faces lit up when Ven Donyo gave them chocolates. The
        Foundation was able to provide 100 jackets, shoes, and school bags to
        these students. After visiting several schools, Ven. Donyo realized that
        many students are barefoot, and have cuts and blisters on their feet
        because they don’t have proper footwear. Therefore, we aim to provide
        1000 pairs of shoes to needy students in 2020.
      </p>
      <h4>2019 Charity Tour of Nepal </h4>

      <p>
        This year, Ven Donyo led a group of 11 members on a Charity Tour of
        Nepal. The group visited pilgrimage sites and ancient cities in and
        around Kathmandu. The group was especially fond of Bodhanath Stupa, the
        center of activity in Kathmandu. Later, they traveled by canoe, jeep,
        and elephant through the jungle in Chitwan National Park, viewing the
        One Horned Rhinocerous, deer, and crocodiles. At the Elephant Breeding
        Center, members were able to give water to baby elephants.
      </p>
      <p>
        The group was lucky to visit Pokhara during Diwali, the Hindu Festival
        of Lights. On the morning the group went to view Annapurna at sunrise,
        groups of children were singing and dancing on the trail. Outside of
        shops and houses on the sidewalks, local people painted flowers with
        thick colored paste, and adorned their offerings with candles. In the
        evening, people played music and danced in the streets. The members had
        a wonderful time exploring the natural areas of culturally rich Nepal.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the last day in Kathmandu, the group met some of the scholarship
        recipients, including Nima Gyaltsen, the law student. Besides tuition,
        one member provided him with a laptop and a motor scooter. Another
        member began to sponsor a college education for a local waitress. They
        also met three nursing students who were home for Diwali break. The
        three are receiving scholarships from the Delek Children’s Foundation.
      </p>
      <h4>Gyuto’s 600th Anniversary Celebration</h4>
      <p>
        During the third part of the trip, Ven Donyo visited Dharamsala with a
        group of 30 members to join his monastery’s 600th anniversary
        celebration. The auspicious occasion was graced by His Holiness the
        Dalai Lama. The following day, Ven. Donyo conducted a tour of the
        buildings and grounds of the Gyuto Monastery. A highlight was the
        dwelling for older monks. The group also attended three days of
        teachings at His Holiness’s temple. After the teachings, the group
        visited the Tibetan Children’s Village school, where some members
        decided to sponsor children. At the offices of the Central Tibetan
        Administration, the group met Lobsang Sangay, the elected President.
        They heard a talk by Geshe Lhakdor, the director of the Tibetan Library
        Archives. The last night, the group attended a special dance performance
        given by the Tibetan Institute of Performing Arts.
      </p>

      <p>
        One group participant who was there for all thirty days called it “the
        trip of a lifetime.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Ven. Donyo would like to thank those members who joined the trip. He
        also wants to thank all the members who have supported the Foundation
        over the years. The Foundation is grateful for your generosity, and we
        hope that you will support us in our future projects. If you would like
