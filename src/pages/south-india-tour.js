        <h3>{"Southern India visiting ancient buddhist caves"}</h3>
        <p>
          The caves were built in two phases starting around the 2nd century BC,
          with the second group of caves built around 400–650 AD. Buddhist Monks
          used to retreat to this serene place during the monsoon, and as they
          had plenty of time during such retreats they used it for deepening
          their religious quest through prayer and discussion.

          It will require 5 days to visit the caves. Cost for the South India is
          <b>$1500</b> per person. If you would like a single room during South

          not recommend to book a single room because it will be costly.
