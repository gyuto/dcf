  "main": "Sponsorship is a way of providing basic needs and education for an underprivileged child or young person through the Delek Childrenâ€™s Foundation. You may directly sponsor a boarding or day student, which means paying set fees on an annual basis. It is up to each sponsor to decide whether they want to be in contact with the child or young person they sponsor or if they wish to remain anonymous. The sponsorship provides school fees, food, clothing, study materials, and simple medical care to enable a student to attend school or college.",
